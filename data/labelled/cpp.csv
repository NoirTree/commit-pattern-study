The new test checks full CPU profiling cycle: using public V8 API it starts profiling, executes a script, stops profiling and analyzes collected profile to check that its top-down tree has expected strutcture. The script that is being profiled is guaranteed to run > 200ms to make sure enough samples are collected.

To avoid possible flakiness due to non-deterministic time required to start new thread on varios OSs when Sampler and ProfilerEventsProcessor threads are being started the main thread is blocked until the threads are running.

Also I removed the heuristic in profile-generator.cc where we try to figure out if the value on top of the sampled stack is return address of some frameless stub invocation. The code periodically gives false positive with the new test ending up in an extra node in the collected cpu profile. After discussion with jkummerow@ we concluded that the logic is too fragile and that we can address frameless stub invocations in a more reliable way later should they have a noticeable effect on cpu profiling.

This is a big refactoring of resolveTypeInContext() which makes the function clearer to understand by merging various special cases and generalizing the logic for walking parent and superclass contexts to cover more cases.
This improves typealiases in protocols a bit:
1) Previously a typealias in a protocol either had to be concrete, or consist of a single path of member types from Self, eg Self.A.B. Lift this restriction, so we can now write things like
protocol Fireworks {
  associatedtype Exploding
  typealias Exploder = Exploding -> [Exploding]
}
2) Protocol typealiases can now be accessed via qualified lookup on concrete types. Getting this working for unqualified lookup requires further refactorings which will be in a subsequent patch.",Describe Objective,,To make improvements,,Summarize Code Object Change,,Characteristics of changes; Object of change,
